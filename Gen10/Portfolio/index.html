        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>I began my career in retail management, but ended up branching off into pharmacy to help pay my way through college. I majored in Aerospace Engineering at UTA where I was involved in a couple leadership roles in different organizations on campus. After graduating I had an internship position under an Aerospace Engineer doing tool design work on engines. Now I'm searching for a role that fits my abilities, but also challenges me to grow as I begin my career in engineering.</p>
